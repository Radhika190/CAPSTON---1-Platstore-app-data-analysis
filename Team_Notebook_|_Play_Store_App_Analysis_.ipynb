Then I have to understand the characteristics of both datasets using describe() method to know its numerical data that they have , like standard deviation ,mean , median, mode  and etc. After this I checked their uniqueness and get the number of unique element of that dataset and also changed their datatype if it required.\n",

        "**TIRTHA BOSE** - My role in this project starts from Data Wrangling and Data Visualisation . Here I tried my best to analysis my data which was a very challenging stuff but  with the help of my teamate and the course provide by almabetter makes it easier for me .While doing this data wrangling I have used different methods() to the values of data like \"value_count()\" , \"mean()\", median(), mode(), std(), sort() , sum(). Then I wrangle data according to the guideline of \"UBM\"(univariate analysis , bivariate ananlysis and multivariate analysis). After that i did the visualisation part by using tools like seaborn(sns), matplotlib.pyplot(plt.) , but it was very difficult for me to plot those graphs according to UBM guideline such that those graphs can justify its questions and also to those  who will see them. \n",
